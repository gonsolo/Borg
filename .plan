Task 1: Basic FPU on software simulator

The heart of a GPU is a shader processor that processes different kinds of instructions, computational, data access and flow control. Start with the simplest and most common ones: floating-point arithmetic.
Milestone 	Amount
1a. Get floating-point multiplication and addition running on a simulator.
1b. Add cocotb tests for the FPU unit and integrate it into TinyQV, a small RISC-V processor written for Tinytapeout.

Task 2: Basic FPU on FPGA

Get the FPU running on a FPGA. This way it can be tested under a full Linux environment.
Milestone 	Amount
2a. Adapt TinyQV's fpga environment to include the FPU.
2b. Write some small compiler or adapt an existing one to compile a small shader to the instruction set supported by the FPU. At this point it hasn't been decided which compiler to use, if any, candidates are LLVM or the Mesa compiler.

Task 3: Vulkan test suite
Milestone 	Amount
3a. Select one of the the Vulkan compute tests from the official test suite. Adapt the Mesa driver to compile it. Write tests to simulate it.
3b. Run the Vulkan compute test on the FPGA.

Task 4: Rinse and repeat
Milestone 	Amount
4a. The full Vulkan Conformance Test Suite (CTS) consists of millions of tests. Expand the number of tests of the Vulkan Compute subsuite that are run successfully.
4b. Add more Vulkan Compute tests like vertex shaders.

Task 5: Send to Tinytapeout.com to get silicon
Milestone 	Amount
5a. On March 23th 2026, the TTIHP26a shuttle for TinyTapeout is scheduled. Prepare and submit it.
5b. On September 9th 2026, the chips are expected. Receive them and test them.
