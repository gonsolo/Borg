# Sample testbench for a Tiny Tapeout project

This is a sample testbench for a Tiny Tapeout project. It uses [cocotb](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/) to drive the DUT and check the outputs.
See below to get started or for more information, check the [website](https://tinytapeout.com/hdl/testing/).

## Setting up

1. Edit [Makefile](Makefile) and modify `PROJECT_SOURCES` to point to your Verilog files.
2. Edit [tb.v](tb.v) and replace `tt_um_example` with your module name.

## How to run

To run the RTL simulation:

```sh
make -B
```

To run gatelevel simulation:

```sh
make -B GATES=yes
```

This simulation automatically detects the IHP PDK and the gate-level netlist in standard local output directories (like `runs/wokwi` or `tt_submission`).

If you wish to save the waveform in VCD format instead of FST format, edit tb.v to use `$dumpfile("tb.vcd");` and then run:

```sh
make -B FST=
```

This will generate `tb.vcd` instead of `tb.fst`.

## How to view the waveform file

Using GTKWave

```sh
gtkwave tb.fst tb.gtkw
```

Using Surfer

```sh
surfer tb.fst
```
